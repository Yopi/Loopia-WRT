You need JFFS (http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/JFFS) in order to use this
script (as you need somewhere to store it).

Enter your loopia credentials into the DDNS config, what is needed is the
username, the hostname and the password.

You then have to create a cronjob (http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/CRON)
to run the script, for example:

*/5 * * * * root /jffs/updateIP.sh
