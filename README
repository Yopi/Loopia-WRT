This is a simple script to update the IP for a domain using looipa.se

The script fetches your external IP and if it differs from the IP that the
domain currently resolvs to, it will change the IP via loopias DynDNS API.

Requirements:

You need JFFS (http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/JFFS) in order to use this
script (as you need somewhere to store it).

Enter your loopia credentials into the DDNS config, what is needed is the
username, the hostname and the password.

You then have to create a cronjob (http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/CRON)
to have the script keep your domain up to date, for example:

*/5 * * * * root /jffs/updateIP.sh
